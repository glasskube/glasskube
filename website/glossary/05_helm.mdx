## What is Helm? Definition and explanation

### Helm Definition

:::info
[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a Kubernetes package manager create to assist in the deployment, management, and scaling of applications within Kubernetes clusters. It uses "charts," which are pre-configured templates that bundle all the necessary Kubernetes resources for an application, enabling users to deploy, upgrade, and roll back applications with relative ease.

## How does Helm fit into the larger Package Management ecosystem?

Helm was the first tool developed to tackle the complexities of managing complex applications in Kubernetes environments. As Kubernetes grew in popularity and adoption so did the microservice archetecture model for building software. Building application components that fit into Kubernetes native resources needed to be managed in some way and Helm came along to address that need. Over the past decade, Helm has become the most widely used Kubernetes package manager. Despite various [shortcomings](/blog/5-helm-shortcomings/), companies of all sizes continue to create Helm charts to make their software easy to install and share.

Many tools are now commonly used alongside Helm or even can leverage it in the backend. Here are some examples of how Helm integrates with other package and configuration managers.

### Helm and Kustomize

Helm and [Kustomize](/glossary/kustomize/) are often used together because each complements the other's strengths. Helm, with its dynamic templating system, is effective for generating the initial base resource definition files for an application. Kustomize, on the other hand, can then layer environment-specific variations on top of these base YAML files through overlays. This approach enables a clean, reusable base configuration that can be tailored to different environments as needed. An added benefit is that Kustomize works directly with YAML files, making them easy to read, understand, and troubleshoot, something that can be challenging with raw Helm templates.

### Helm and Glasskube

[Glasskube](/products/package-manager/) is a Kubernetes package manager that extends and complements Helm in multiple ways, supporting multiple package formats, including Helm charts and plain YAML files. Glasskube addresses several of Helmâ€™s limitations, providing enhanced functionality such as:

-   The ability to manage dependencies between charts
-   A server-side component that enables more lifecycle actions post-installation
-   Simplified value injection
-   Availability of both a CLI and a console interface
-   Easy integration with GitOps workflows for fully declarative package management
-   Automated updates

These features make Glasskube a versatile tool for Kubernetes users seeking enhanced management capabilities beyond Helm.
