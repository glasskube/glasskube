## What is BYOC?

### Definition

:::info
**B**ring **Y**our **O**wn **C**loud (**BYOC**) is a deployment model through which organizations host applications and data within their own cloud accounts, keeping control over their data while allowing vendors to manage software and infrastructure. BYOC is popular with industries requiring strict data sovereignty, security, and compliance measures, as it minimizes vendor access to sensitive information within a customer's VPC. Though it involves a shared responsibility model, BYOC is a compelling option for companies that need a balance between control and vendor support without fully self-hosting.

### Bring your own cloud explained

In a nutshell, the way BYOC works from a technical perspective is that a software customer provisions a new VPC in its own cloud environment and grants the Independent Software Vendor (ISV) access to it. As a rule of thumb, zero-trust security frameworks should be in place to ensure the ISV has the least privilege necessary to operate the software and infrastructure within the customer's VPC. This setup not only enhances security but also allows the customer to maintain greater control over their data and compliance requirements.

### Responsibility sharing in BYOC

**Customer Responsibilities:**

-   Provision and maintain the VPC environment
-   Enforce data access policies with least privilege
-   Ensure compliance with regulatory standards
-   Monitor network and security events


**ISV Responsibilities:**

-   Deploy and maintain the software within the VPC
-   Follow least-privilege access controls
-   Align with customer’s compliance needs
-   Monitor software performance and incidents
-   Apply updates, patches, and bug fixes
-   Manage infrastructure scaling and maintenance inside the VPC


### Why choose BYOC?

BYOC might be chosen out of preference or necessity. For some companies heavily invested in cloud infrastructure, BYOC allows them to leverage their existing cloud commitments by deploying new software within their own environment. This approach lets them enjoy the convenience and support of a SaaS model without fully taking on the complexities of self-management.

Alternatively, organizations in highly regulated industries, such as government, finance, and healthcare, may require strict data sovereignty and security compliance. BYOC offers a solution by ensuring that data ownership remains with the customer and that sensitive information doesn’t leave their VPC, making it an ideal option for these compliance-driven environments.
