## What is Kubernetes Configuration Management? Definition and explanation

### Definition

> Kubernetes configuration management is the process of organizing, maintaining, and customizing application and infrastructure configurations in a Kubernetes environment.

Effective configuration management is essential in [Kubernetes](/docs/glossary/kubernetes/) to ensure that applications run consistently across different environments while allowing for environment-specific variations. [Kustomize](/docs/glossary/kustomize) is an excellent tool for this purpose, as it allows users to define a "base" configuration and apply "overlays" to tailor it for each environment without duplicating code. With Kustomize, teams can manage configurations declaratively, making it easier to maintain, understand, and adapt their Kubernetes resources as needs evolve.
