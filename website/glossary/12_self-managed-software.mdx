## What is Self-Managed?

### Self-Managed Software Definition

:::info
Self-managed deployment is a model where organizations are responsible for fully hosting, operating, and maintaining software within their own infrastructure, either on-premises or in a private or public cloud environments. This approach gives customers complete control over their environment, including data security, compliance, and access management, which is often crucial for highly regulated industries. Unlike SaaS or BYOC, self-managed solutions require organizations to handle software setup, updates, scaling, and ongoing maintenance.

### How Does Self-Managed Software Work?

In a self-managed deployment scenario, software customers typically purchase a license, download and install the software package onto their own servers or cloud environment. They handle all infrastructure-related tasks, including server setup, storage allocation, network configuration, and security protocols. Updates and patches are also tasked to the organization’s IT or DevOps team, who also monitor the system’s health, manage backups, and troubleshoot any issues. This deployment model demands a higher level of technical expertise and always incurs more significant ongoing IT costs, but it offers unmatched customization and control.

### Why Choose Self-Managed Software?

Self-managed deployment is often chosen by organizations that require complete control over their environment, particularly in industries with stringent data sovereignty, security, and compliance requirements, such as finance, government, and healthcare. This model is also preferred by companies with unique operational needs or specialized infrastructure requirements, as it allows for full customization and integration with existing systems.

While it involves a larger internal resource commitment, self-managed deployment is ideal for businesses and government agencies with the expertise and resources to manage their own infrastructure and for those needing a high degree of autonomy and data control. This model prioritizes control and flexibility at the expense of convenience and ease of scaling.
