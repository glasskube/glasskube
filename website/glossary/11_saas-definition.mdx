## What is SaaS?

### SaaS definition

:::info
**S**oftware **a**s **a** **S**ervice (SaaS) is a widely adopted cloud-based deployment model in which independent software vendors (ISVs) provide software access to their applications over the internet, handling infrastructure, updates, security, and support on behalf of their customers. For many vendors, this model is preferable, and when restrictions permit, it’s often highly desirable for customers as well. With SaaS, customers can use applications in a “plug and play“ kind of way, the only onboarding involved has to do with the correct use of the software and infrastructure maintenance is fully offloaded to the vendor.

### How does SaaS work?

SaaS functions by delivering vendor-hosted application access directly to the end user in exchange for a subscription fee, subscription models usually with pricing based on usage or a flat rate. Users access the software through web browsers or specialized client apps, often with login credentials. All updates, patches, and infrastructure changes are handled by the provider. This model allows customers to focus on using the application rather than managing the hardware, networks, or servers it runs on.

### Why Choose SaaS?

SaaS is often chosen for its convenience and lower upfront costs. Organizations that need to quickly scale their application usage can do so without the added burden of infrastructure management. This makes SaaS ideal for businesses experiencing rapid growth, startups, or companies that don’t want to invest heavily in IT. Additionally, SaaS is commonly adopted by industries with distributed teams or remote workforces, as it allows employees to access applications and data from anywhere with internet access.

For businesses in industries that don’t require stringent control over data location, such as retail, professional services, and creative industries. As a software deployment model it’s the most convenient and straightforward at the expense of user control.
