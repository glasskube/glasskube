## We got accepted into the CNCF Landscape

Glasskube is now visible next other relevant projects in the cloud native ecosystem landscape like Helm or Backstage.

[![Glasskube CNCF Landscape](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube/assets/3041752/54b8adad-e88f-4853-9250-e8c3bbbad993)](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube/)

The goal of the cloud-native landscape is to gather and categorize projects that are relevant to the cloud native developers,
offering a comprehensive overview of the existing ecosystem.

By exploring this landscape, project teams can make informed decisions about tooling, technology stack selection, and best practices.
Moreover, it facilitates access to emerging innovations, fosters community collaboration, and ensures compatibility and interoperability,
all of which are critical for the success of Kubernetes deployments.

## Glasskube is part of the Application Definition & Image Build category

Application definition and image build tools encompass developer-focused and operations-focused functionalities,
aiming to simplify Kubernetes deployment and app management.
They address challenges of complexity in containerized environments, offering solutions for reproducible image creation,
standardized app deployment, and simplifying developer and operator experiences. Tools include Helm for deploying third-party apps,
the Operator Framework for building and deploying operators, and Cloud Native Buildpacks for containerizing application code.
These tools help streamline Kubernetes development and operations, offering diverse solutions for various use cases.

## Accepted in just 7 days after the launch

The pull request [#3735](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/pull/3735) got accepted just 7 days after the released of our first
