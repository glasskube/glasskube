## Most notable changes

### Dependency management 🔗

Building on the package installation features shipped in the previous weeks, we now offer an in-built way of managing 
and installing the dependencies used by your desired package. Now package maintainers can define the appropriate dependencies, for 
each Glasskube supported package as well as recommending the range of suitable dependency versions, this way ensuring that packages are always
compatible to accompanying dependency.

Package dependencies will show on the installation drop down in the GUI. They will also be shown when installing a package via the CLI.

### Dark Mode 🕶️

Great news, we shipped the "must-have" feature any OSS project can't survive without, `Dark Mode`. Glasskube's dark mode is linked to the display mode
defined on your local system. Access your system preferences menu and try it out!

### Further improvements

We also worked hard on improving existing commands and our GUI. Here's a list of further notable changes:

* The `--latest` flag was added to the `glasskube bootstrap` command to ensure the latest version of the package controller is being used.
* The GUI now reflects the available dependencies for selected packages.
* We expanded the `describe` command to include the installed dependencies.
* You will now be greeted by a notification pop-up if "open" fails.
* Version mismatch detection was added to the package controller.

### BREAKING changes

*This release does not contain any breaking changes*.
