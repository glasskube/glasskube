## Most notable changes

Of all changes, bugfixes and improvements, two new features stand out in the second release:

### The `open` command

Introducing Glasskube's newest feature: the `open` command!
Gone are the days of laboriously setting up multiple TCP tunnels with `kubectl port-forward` just to access specific services.
With Glasskube, accessing your desired services is now as easy as a click or a simple command.
Say goodbye to unnecessary complexity and hello to effortless convenience.

### Realtime updates with htmx

The second-biggest achievement of this release: The integration of htmx for real-time updates.
This advanced feature enables automatic and instantaneous updates to your graphical user interface,
eliminating the need for manual page refreshes.
With htmx, your application stays dynamically synchrorzed with backend changes, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.
