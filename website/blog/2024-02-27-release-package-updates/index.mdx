## Most notable changes

### Package Updates

Updating packages is one of the most essential features of any package manager. That's why most of our efforts in the past two weeks
have gone into the support for such updates via CLI and GUI. It's as easy as typing `glasskube update` into the command line,
or a button click in the GUI.

During package installation you now can decide whether you want automatic updates for the package, in which case the
Glasskube package operator will take care of keeping you up to date at all times. You can of course opt out of this feature
if you prefer to handle updates manually. Apart from that, with the `--version` flag you can choose which version of a package is to be installed,
if your use case requires a specific version.

For technical details, please have a look at the [package operator documentation](/docs/components/package-operator/#handling-package-updates).

### Further improvements

We also worked hard on improving existing commands and our GUI. Here's a list of further notable changes:

* The `glasskube describe` command – and its GUI-complement, the package detail page – have been implemented for you to have a more detailed
view on each of the packages available in Glasskube.
* `glasskube list` has been extended with the new flags `--outdated` – listing only outdated packages, and `--show-latest` – showing the
latest available version for each package.
* All commands check for a newer version of Glasskube, and notify you if you are not up to date anymore.
* Glasskube is now even easier to set up: The GUI comes with handy pages for selecting a kubeconfig and for bootstrapping Glasskube in a cluster.
All CLI commands will also support you in setting up Glasskube in your cluster.
* Streaming any kind of package status change directly into the GUI, making it easier for you to recognize when something is happening in the background.

### BREAKING changes
