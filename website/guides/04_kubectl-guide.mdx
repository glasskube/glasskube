What **kind of engineer are you**? 🤔
Can somebody guess by just looking at you?
More than likely not.

Would that somebody be able to tell by looking at your keyboard instead?
Might be a bit easier now. ⌨️

You know you are dealing with a **Kubernetes engineer** when the “k“ key on their keyboard has seen better days.
At the [Glasskube](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube) office, you will find spare **“k“** keys all over the place, just in case 😄

I’m joking of course.
I’m not really sure about what a faded keyboard says about its owner. What I do know for sure is how important `kubectl` is to anybody who wants to be a proficient [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) administrator.

`kubectl` is the CLI tool used to communicate to the Kubernetes API it can seem simple at first but can quickly get complicated.
So in this blog post, I aim to write **the guide I wish I had when I started**. Focusing first on command syntax and useful commands, before moving on to the vibrant ecosystem of [plugins](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/plugins/) and tools built to expand the functionalities of `kubectl` and Kubernetes.
Sharing tips and tricks along the way as well as a helpful `kubecltl cheatsheet` at the end. 📋

Let’s get to it. ☸️

## Disclaimer 🛑

> This isn’t an article about Kubernetes. K8s is an incredibly vast technology, encompassing numerous concepts, such as various types of Kubernetes objects and their interactions. For this discussion, I'll assume you're familiar with these concepts. Instead, I'll focus specifically on `kubectl`, its usage, and the tools built around it.

## Just before we begin

If you are a fan of supporting Open Source projects working to make Kubernetes package management better for everyone then please consider supporting Glasskube, by giving us a Star on GitHub 🙏

[![Screenshot 2024-04-26 at 10 54 54](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube/assets/38757612/05a03edf-7d6a-48fd-9b24-598abcfd1e9a)](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube)

## Installation

To install `kubectl`, you have a few different options depending on your operating system. Here's how to install it on some common platforms:

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
```

### MacOS using Homebrew

```
brew install kubectl
```

### Windows using Chocolatey

```
choco install kubernetes-cli
```

After installation, you can verify if kubectl has been installed correctly by running:

```
kubectl version --client
```

## kubectl commands:

`kubectl` is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool used to communicate with the Kubernetes API. There are many commands, too many to remember.

![k8s hard gif](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j94hbqfxgqd8g669b7x1.png)

Don’t worry though it’s not as daunting as some might want you to think.

We will explore ways to quickly access command references, k8s-object-specific commands, helpful aliases, and command completion. But first, how are command strings built?

## The syntax

English and Chinese are `subject-verb-object (SVO)` languages.

Hindi and Korean are `subject-object-verb (SOV)` languages.

If kubectl were a language, it would be a `kubectl + verb + object/[name optional] + flag` (kvof) language 😄

![kubectl syntax](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube/assets/3041752/ebb44c40-d2c4-4889-9776-a7a803f6061c)

Also similar to languages, the best way to learn and absorb grammar is by using it in context and not memorizing long verb and object lists.

> ℹ️ If you are stuck and want to quickly reference the existing Kubernetes objects in any Kubernetes version run `kubectl api-resources`.

Commands are built by choosing that `action [verb]` you want to apply to the desired Kubernetes `resource [object]` usually followed by the name of the resource additionally you have a large array of `filters [flags]` that can be applied to the command which will determine the final scope and output.

![kubectl command building](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube/assets/3041752/5d9d417a-2012-44d5-99b9-fdf6e0331785)

Let’s look at a simple example of command building using the commonly used `get` verb to retrieve all resources in the `glasskube-system` namespace, and the output is in `yaml` format:

```
kubectl get all --namespace glasskube-system -o yaml
```

> ℹ️ If you come across a Kubernetes resource that you haven’t heard of before or need a refresher use `kubectl explain [resource-name]` to get an in-terminal description and usage instructions.

## Working imperatively

When working in Kubernetes environments your tasks are many, anything from deploying new apps, troubleshooting faulty resources, inspecting usage, and much more. Later on, we will explore how useful declarative ways of working are more appropriate for defining and deploying workloads, but for everything else we have our arsenal of useful imperative Kubernetes commands at the ready.

Simple commands to get us started are:

```
# Create a new deployment named "nginx-deployment" with the nginx image
kubectl run nginx-deployment --image=nginx

# Delete a pod named "nginx-deployment" in the default namespace
kubectl delete pod nginx-deployment
```
To take imperative commands to the next step know that you can modify resources by using the [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20text%2Dbased%20user,before%20the%20advent%20of%20bitmapped) editor:
By running `kubectl edit -n [namespace] [resource-name]` a text editor like the one below will open. Make you edits and close the editor just like in [vim](https://www.vim.org/) by running `ESC + :q!`.

```
# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
# reopened with the relevant failures.
#
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container: manager
  creationTimestamp: "2024-04-22T17:07:39Z"
  generateName: glasskube-controller-manager-556ff6fccf-
  labels:
    control-plane: controller-manager
    pod-template-hash: 556ff6fccf
  name: glasskube-controller-manager-556ff6fccf-4qlxz
  namespace: glasskube-system
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: apps/v1
    blockOwnerDeletion: true
    controller: true
    kind: ReplicaSet
    name: glasskube-controller-manager-556ff6fccf
    uid: 430e90e9-32f3-45f6-92dc-4bae26ae1654
"/var/folders/2q/wjmbwg1n5vn8v7vlw17nsz0h0000gn/T/kubectl-edit-1306753911.yaml" 209L, 5898B
```

Most commands are applicable to all sorts of Kubernetes objects. Insofar as it is useful further down we will touch on specific commands that are useful for certain Kubernetes resources. Before that though, it’s worth learning about some useful flags that can be applied to many different objects.

## Useful flags:
**--env:**

The `--env` flag allows you to specify environment variables for the container being created.
```
kubectl run nginx-deployment --image=nginx --env="ENV_VARIABLE=value"
```

**--template:**
This flag allows you to specify a Go template for the output format of your kubectl command. It's handy when you want to customize the output structure, filtering, or presentation.

```
kubectl get pods --template='{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```

**--dry-run=[client/server]:**
Massively useful when you want render a manifest for an object you don't remember how to write from scratch or have a template at hand. The `--dry-run` flag prints the object manifest that would be sent without sending it. Use the `server` option to see the server side request that would be generated.

```
kubectl create secret generic github-api-token --from-literal token=$GITHUB_TOKEN --dry-run=client -o yaml
```
Concatenating the command with other tools can be very useful too.
Taking the example above, you can pipe the output of the generated manifest and pass in into a third party secret manager like [Sealed-secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) to create a kubeseal secret manifest.
```
kubectl create secret generic github-api-token --from-literal token=$GITHUB_TOKEN --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml > api-token-secret.sealed.yaml
```

**--field-selector:**
With this flag, you can filter resources based on specific fields. For instance, you can filter pods based on their status or labels.

```
kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Running
```

**--field-selector type=[Normal/Warning]:**
This is a specific use of the --field-selector flag, where you filter events based on their type, either Normal or Warning.

**kubectl events -n [resource-namespace] --for=[resource-kind]/[resource-name]: **
This command fetches events related to a specific resource in the specified namespace. It continuously watches for new events related to the given resource.

```
kubectl events -n my-namespace --for=deployment/my-deployment
```

## Old School vs. New School watching flags:

**watch vs. -w**:

`watch`: This is a traditional Unix command used to execute a specified command repeatedly at regular intervals, displaying its output in the terminal. Unlike the -w flag in kubectl, the watch command does not automatically update the terminal output when changes occur.

`-w`: This is a modern flag in kubectl that enables continuous watching for changes to resources.

## Working with Pods

Pods are the smallest abstraction inside the Kubernetes ecosystem, they are the logical units that house your containers. Pods consume resources and can be executed into and produce logs. Here are some commands that will help you manage pods.

```
# Show resource usage of a pod
kubectl top pod -n [namespace] [pod-name]

# Run a command inside a new pod in the cluster
kubectl run -it ubuntu --image ubuntu --rm -- bash

# Show resource labels as columns
# e.g. kubectl get pods -n [namespace] -L vault-active -L vault-sealed
kubectl get pods -n [namespace] -L vault-active -L vault-sealed

# Execute a command inside a pod
kubectl exec -it [pod-name] -n [namespace] --

# Port forward to a pod
kubectl port-forward [pod-name] [local-port]:[remote-port] -n [namespace]

# Show container logs
kubectl logs -n [namespace] [pod-name]
kubectl logs -n [namespace] /deployment/[deployment-name]  # Use -f flag for continuous streaming

# Run a command inside an existing container
kubectl exec -it -n [namespace] [pod-name] -- [command...]
```

## Working with nodes

Nodes are the underlying instances that provide computational power and storage on top of which your Kubernetes cluster runs.

```
# Show node resource utilization
kubectl top node [node-name]  # Node name is optional; without shows table of all nodes

# Get node information
kubectl get node
```

## Working with Deployments, DaemonSets and StatefulSets

Deployments, DaemonSets, and StatefulSets are higher-level abstractions in Kubernetes that manage the deployment and scaling of application workloads.

```
# Restart a workload (e.g. deployment, stateful set, daemon set)
kubectl rollout restart -n [namespace] [workload-kind]/[workload-name]  # Triggers a re-creation of all pods for this workload, adhering to the workload configuration

# Check the status of a deployment rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/[name]

# View rollout history of a deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment/[name]  # View rollout history of a deployment

# Scale a deployment to the specified number of replicas
kubectl scale deployment/ --replicas=[number]  # Scale a deployment to the specified number of replicas

# Watch events related to a deployment
kubectl events -n glasskube-system --for=deployment/glasskube-controller-manager

#Update Deployment Image
kubectl set image deployment/[deployment-name] [container-name]=new-image:tag

# Delete DaemonSet
kubectl delete daemonset [daemonset-name]
```

## Working with jobs

Jobs manage the execution of pods to perform a particular task and ensure the task is completed successfully before terminating.

```
# Run a CronJob manually
kubectl create job [job-name] --image=image/name

# Creates a new job from the job template specified in the cronjob
kubectl create job -n [namespace] --from=cronjob/[cron-job-name] [job-name]
```

## Working with secrets

Secrets are used to store sensitive information like passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys securely in Kubernetes.

```
# Create Secret
kubectl create secret generic [secret-name] --from-literal=key1=value1 --from-file=ssh-privatekey=~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Get a value from a secret
kubectl get secrets -n [namespace] [secret-name] --template='{{ .data.[key-name] | base64decode }}'

# Get a value from a secret using jsonpath
kubectl get secrets [secret-name] -o jsonpath="{.data.key1}" | base64 --decode
```

> ℹ️ JSONPath is a query language used to extract specific data from JSON documents. In Kubernetes, JSONPath expressions are often used with the -o jsonpath flag in kubectl commands to extract specific information from the output of those commands.

## Shell completions

As you have probably noticed, `kubectl` commands can get long in no time. A really nifty shell completion script can be added to your `bash` or `zshell` file to enable easy tab completions. No more memorizing.
To do so in all your shell sessions, add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```
source <(kubectl completion zsh)
```

And restart the shell.
Follow the instructions here if you are using `bash`:
```
# Install bash-completion package
sudo apt-get install -y bash-completion
# Store the output of the completion command in .bashrc
echo "source <(kubectl completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
# Activate the completion rules
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Working declaratively

Declarative management of Kubernetes resources involves specifying the desired state of your resources using YAML manifest files and applying those manifests to the cluster.

### Create YAML files
All Kubernetes objects are defined in YAML files, regardless if you write them yourself or not, YAML file definitions are how the Kubernetes API knows what the state of the cluster should be:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: glasskube-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: glasskube
      env: prod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: glasskube
        env: prod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: glasskube-container
        image: your-glasskube-image:latest
```

To create this deployment from scratch use the `kubectl create` command:
```
kubectl create -f glasskube-deployment.yaml
```

### Apply YAML Files (client-side apply)

Applying YAML files is the standard method for managing Kubernetes resources. You define the desired state of your resources in YAML format and apply those YAML files to the cluster.

```
 kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
```

### Server-Side Apply (SSA)

Server-Side Apply is a newer approach to applying configuration changes to Kubernetes resources. With SSA, changes are applied directly on the server side, meaning that the Kubernetes API server takes responsibility for ensuring that the desired state is achieved.

```
kubectl apply --server-side -f manifest.yaml
```

## Plugins and tooling 🧰

Whenever I see some back and forth around what Kubernetes is and isn’t. What use cases it’s best suited for and how should it best be thought of, the same [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/935252923721793536?lang=en) tweet pops into my head.

![Kelsey Hightower tweet](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lpzdruwnpv86nmmj9n8x.png)

The sentiment is widely agreed upon, as evidenced by the extensive ecosystem of Kubernetes plugins and tools designed to assist in various stages of the Kubernetes lifecycle.

### Krew the Kubernetes plugin manager
A great plugin manager to find new plugins is [krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/), install is here.

Command to install `kubectl` plugins via Krew:

```
kubectl krew install <PLUGIN_NAME>
```

Let’s explore some of the main plguing and tooling categories and highlight some of the most useful projects out there. Since there are so many worth bringing attention to, I will add a section of `Honorable mentions` to each section.

### Content and Namespace switching 🔀
In Kubernetes environments, you consistently operate within 2  hierarchical contexts the clusters and the namespaces. Ensuring accurate command execution requires specifying the appropriate context to obtain the desired output. Switching cluster contexts or namespaces can involve lengthy commands to remember, which is where tools like Kubectl and Kubens come in.

#### Kubectx and Kubens
Easily see the available clusters and namespaces and swith between them effortlessly.
Installation instructions [here](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx).

![Kubectx screenshare](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jbj2i5ay7w1ibgq3euwy.gif)

**Honorable mentions:**

- [kubectl-cf](https://github.com/surfinggo/kubectl-cf): A faster way to switch between kubeconfig files (not contexts).

### Visibility 🔭
Kubernetes clusters are complex systems, with many moving parts that depend on each other so that your apps run. To have clear visibility into what is happening at all times is crucial.

#### k9s
[K9s](https://k9scli.io/) is a handy and low-weight interactive Kubernetes dashboard that runs right in the terminal. As well as visualizing your k8s resources, you can also easily execute into pods, edit manifest, and manage your workloads all in one place. It is probably one of my favorite tools for Kubernetes management

Install is [here.](https://k9scli.io/topics/install/)

Example:
You can check the status of a running cluster with the following command.
```
$ kubepug --k8s-version=v1.22 # Will verify the current context against v1.22 version
[...]
RESULTS:
Deprecated APIs:
PodSecurityPolicy found in policy/v1beta1
	 ├─ Deprecated at: 1.21
	 ├─ PodSecurityPolicy governs the ability to make requests that affect the Security Context that will be applied to a pod and container.Deprecated in 1.21.
		-> OBJECT: restrictive namespace: default

Deleted APIs:
	 APIs REMOVED FROM THE CURRENT VERSION AND SHOULD BE MIGRATED IMMEDIATELY!!

> ℹ️ Some security implications of using `kubectl` plugins include possible Vulnerabilities, Privilege Escalation, and inadvertent Data Leakage. Make sure to only use actively maintained plugins and ideally have an active community around them.

## Aliases 📇
With so many `kubectl` commands to remember, simplify your life by using keyboard shortcuts or aliases.

Here you will find a [repo](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectl-aliases) with contains [a script](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectl-aliases/blob/master/generate_aliases.py) to generate hundreds of convenient shell aliases for `kubectl`. The thing is that many of the aliases are long and might become hard to recall. Don’t worry though I found this [very pragmatic blog post by Benoit Couetil](https://dev.to/zenika/kubernetes-a-pragmatic-kubectl-aliases-collection-17oc) on how to deal with the many aliases generated by the above script.
