[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) are open-source, community-backed solutions with stellar reputations. They bring immense value by fetching and storing metrics while enabling the creation of dashboards that are not only useful but also easy on the eyes.

The uncomfortable truth is that anyone who has ever set up `Prometheus` alongside `Grafana` as their environment's monitoring stack from scratch has probably felt the frustration of not getting value especially quickly. Metric exporter configuration, dashboard widget customisation and deciding what to monitor and alert on in the first place takes time.

That's why [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) was created. It installs a collection of Kubernetes manifests, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus rules, providing an easy-to-operate, end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring solution with Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator.

This sounds like good news, and it is, but the stack is bundled in a Helm chart, and just the `values.yaml` file has _over 4000 lines_. Configuring and maintaining the Helm chart isn’t necessarily straightforward or “fun.”

With so many configuration options, we must be getting something good right? Well yeah, we are, by deploying kube-prometheus-stack we get all of this right out of the box:

**Top Layer:**

- **User:** Interacts with Grafana and Kubernetes API.

**Visualization and Alerting Layer:**

- **[Grafana](https://grafana.com/):** Connects to Prometheus for data visualization.
- **[Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/):** Connected to Prometheus for alert management.
- **[Prometheus Server](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus):** Central component collecting and storing metrics.

**Exporters Layer:**

- **[Node Exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/):** Collects node-level metrics.
- **[Kube State Metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics):** Collects metrics from Kubernetes API objects.
- **Other Exporters:** Additional exporters for various applications and services.

**Kubernetes Cluster:**

- **Kubernetes Nodes**: Running applications and system components.
- **Applications:** Monitored by the Kube Prometheus Stack.

Luckily, [Glasskube](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube) now supports the `kube-prometheus-stack`. Package configuration, lifecycle management, and installation can be done in record time.

In this blog post, we will explore the steps to configure and install the `kube-prometheus-stack` using [Glasskube](/), wasting no unnecessary time wrestling with never-ending values files and getting you working dashboards and alerts quicker than ever before.

### Requirements:

- Access to a **Kubernetes cluster** ([Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start) will be fine)
- [Glasskube](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube) installed
- An extra screen for all the cool dashboards you are going to want to look at all the time. 🤣

### Create a cluster

Install [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start) then run:
```
minikube start
```
Check your installation by running:
```
minukube status
```
Desired output:
```
➜  ~ minikube status
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```
### Install Glasskube

If you already installed `glasskube` you can skip this step.
If not, `glasskube` can easily be installed the way you usually install packages for your operating system.

<Install />

### Install kube-prometheus-stack

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="gui" label="GUI 🖥️">
    Start the UI via the command line:

    ```shell
    glasskube serve
    ```

    Install kube-prometheus-stack via the Glasskube UI by following the package customization steps below.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI 🧑‍💻">
    A package can be installed with a simple command.

    ```shell
    glasskube install kube-prometheus-stack
    ```

    The process will wait until the package got successfully installed.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Package Customization

Glasskube offers a series of customisations that we can be tweaked and adjusted from the CLI or GUI, saving you from having to render and configure the `values.yaml` file directly.

![parameter config](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w7txd2o9vw0mxvrebj3g.png)

Let’s take them one by one.

### Enable Alertmanager 🚨

We want `Alertmanager` to be enabled so we can leverage the metrics prometheus exposes to create helpful alerts.

### Grafana Domain 📊

We will leave this empty for this demo since we would need to deploy an ingress controller to our cluster to handle the ingress object associated with the grafana service. We could use [kube-prometheus-stack](/guides/kube-prometheus-stack/) or [caddy-ingress](https://github.com/caddyserver/ingress) which are also supported by Glasskube for this.
> Glasskube will automatically port-forward the Grafana pod so we can access the dashboard via the `Open` button.

### Node Exporter host network 💽

Let’s also enable this to export node level metrics like memory and node level CPU usage.

### Prometheus retention 📅

This is a duration in days for how long we want to persist the collected metrics.

### Prometheus storage size

The amount of storage requests we consider the package will need.

### Parameter input methods 🗄️

Glasskube allows for various methods of parameter input:

- From a **Kubernetes Secret**
- From **ConfigMap**
- Value from **Package Configuration**
- Via the **UI**

![data input methods](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e8dd9vj10hqw13qk98td.png)

By choosing to inject data via **Kubernetes Secrets**, **ConfigMaps** and **Package configuration** we can maintain simplicity without compromising security.

Here is the example of how we would reference a specific `configMap` we have already created and deployed to our cluster.

> 💡 If you're using `kube-prometheus-stack` and considering Glasskube for package lifecycle management but need support for specific key parameter customizations, please [open an issue](https://github.com/glasskube/glasskube/issues) on GitHub with your use case. We'll do our best to expand the parameter list accordingly.

## Install via Glasskkube

Once the configuration section is complete, install `kube-prometheus-stack.`

![Glasskube UI](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2ch181euwexulffkli9d.png)

Upon installation you can see that the `kube-prometheus-stack` namespace has been created. And a series of pods have been deployed, including the `grafana` dashboard, the `prometheus operator` and the `kube state metrics` pods too.

![cli output](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l3pgws4cf2qtib4449m3.png)

## Access the dashboards

> _In next weeks blog post we will access the dashboard via a custom dedicated Grafana URL_

![open command](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mnt9zl5qxuq8cd54qwni.gif)

Hit the `Open` button or if you want to access Grafana on a different port you can simply `port-forward` the pod, which will map the exposed Grafana port to a port on your localhost. I've arbitrarily chosen to `port-forward` to `localhost 52222` since it's available.
```
kubectl port-forward POD_NAME 52222:3000
```
Head over to `http://localhost:52222/` and you will then be greated by the Granfana login page. To find your credentials which are stored in a Kubernetes secret that was generated as part of the deployed stack, run:

```
kubectl get secret kube-prometheus-stack-kube-prometheus-stack-grafana  -o go-template='
{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf "%s: " $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```

Which will output something like:
```
admin-password: <password>
admin-user: admin
ldap-toml:
```
Upon access you we be greeted by a long list of powerful pre-configured Grafana dashboards which are already showing local cluster metrics:

![dashboards](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6qet3srm7xly065jfbx5.png)

### Easily access CPU usage information

## Alerting

We already get many useful alerts created for us right out of the box.

![alerting rules](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ptnr7vl5hux0hur8tzh3.png)

In this snippet you can see that some of the preconfigured alerts are already firing: ↘️

![firing alerts](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0dguekqv6cg5yox9ofq4.png)

If you want to be notified in via **email**, **PagerDuty** or any number of third party supported you will just need to add your [contact points](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/fundamentals/notifications/contact-points/#:~:text=A%20contact%20point%20is%20a,custom%20message%2C%20or%20notification%20templates.) of preference and then add them as destination inside [custom notification policies](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/create-notification-policy/).

The `kube-prometheus-stack` offers tremendous **"out-of-the-box"** value for Kubernetes cluster monitoring, eliminating the need to start from scratch. It bundles essential components for metrics exposure, extraction, alerting, and visualization, helping you establish a robust monitoring posture from the get-go. With official support from `Glasskube`, managing and updating a comprehensive, best practice-compliant monitoring stack has never been easier.
