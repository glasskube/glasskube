# Glasskube vs Helm Comparison

Glasskube is not a replacement for Helm. Helm has its strengths in configuring releases through templating and having the ability to perform upgrades and rollbacks.

Glasskube is laser focused on the administrator who needs to only install and kustomize (pun intended ðŸ˜‰) a single application, but who also needs to make sure multiple packages are kept up-to-date and secure throughout multiple Kubernetes version upgrades and adapting to inevitable breaking changes.
