# Welcome

üì¶Ô∏è Glasskube will help you to **install your favorite Kubernetes packages**.

ü§Ø Using **traditional package managers** or applying manifests can be **super confusing**.

üòç Using the **Glasskube UI** for reduced complexity and increased transparency.

üßë‚Äçüíª Still providing a **brew inspired CLI** for advanced users.

üèóÔ∏è Glasskube **packages are dependency aware**, as you would expect from a package manager.

ü§ñ Designed as a cloud native application, so you can follow your **GitOps approach**.

> Glasskube is an open-source Kubernetes package manager that simplifies package management for Kubernetes.

## Fast Track ‚è±Ô∏è {#fast-track}

Install your first package in 5 minutes.

Install Glasskube via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install glasskube/tap/glasskube
```

Bootstrap Glasskube in your cluster:

```
glasskube bootstrap
```

Start the package manager:

```bash
glasskube serve
```

Open [`http://localhost:8580`](http://localhost:8580) and explore available packages.

For more installation options see the [Getting started](getting-started/install) section.

## Architecture üìè {#architecture}

Glasskube uses multiple components, most notably a client and a package operator.

### Components

#### Client

The client is an executable written in Go. It accepts user inputs via a UI and CLI.

The client manages packages in the form of Kubernetes Resources via the Kubernetes API.

#### Package Operator

The package operator has two controllers:

1. The Package Controller (managing packages)
2. The PackageInfo Controller (syncing package infos from a repository)

#### Package Repository

A place where `PackageManifest`s are stored, searched and maintained.
There is a central package repository managed by Glasskube: [`glasskube/packages`](https://github.com/glasskube/packages),
however using custom package repositories is supported too, see [Glasskube Repositories](design/repositories).

## Commands

For any command, by default the cluster given in `~/.kube/config` (`current-context`) will be used.
An alternative kube config can be passed with the `--kubeconfig` flag.

### `glasskube bootstrap`

Bootstraps Glasskube in the given cluster. For more information, check out our [bootstrap guide](./getting-started/bootstrap).

### `glasskube serve`

Starts the UI server and opens a browser on [http://localhost:8580](http://localhost:8580).

### `glasskube list`

Lists packages. By default, all packages available in the configured repository are shown, including their installation status in the given cluster.

With the `--installed` flag you can restrict the list of packages to the ones installed in your cluster.
If you only want to see installed packages that have a newer version available, use the `--outdated` flag.

### `glasskube install <package>`

Installs the latest version of a package in your cluster and waits until the installation is either finished successfully or failed.

Use `--version=...` if you want to install a specific version of a package, or `--enable-auto-updates` if you want a package to always be updated to the latest version automatically.

If a package offers configuration parameters, `glassube install` provides a workflow to interactively set those parameters.
For non-interactive parameter configuration, you can use `--value` (can be used multiple times).

For more information, check out `glasskube help install`.

### `glasskube update <packages...>`

Updates the given packages in your cluster to their respecive latest version.
If no packages are specified, all outdated packages will be updated.

### `glasskube configure <package>`

Interactively or non-interactively modify the configuration of a package.

Use `--value` for non-interactive mode (can be used multiple times).
If you want to delete existing values, use `--keep-old-values=false` (can be used in combination with `--value`)

For more information, check out `glasskube help configure`.

### `glasskube uninstall <package>`

Removes the given package from your cluster.

### `glasskube describe <package>`

Shows additional information about the given package.

### `glasskube open <package>`

Opens the default entrypoint of the given package.
Use `glasskube open <package> <entrypoint>` to open a specific entrypoint.

### `glasskube repo`

Manages the package repositories of the cluster. `glasskube repo list` lists the currently configured repositories,
while `glasskube repo add` allows you to add new repositories to your cluster.

### `glasskube purge`

Uninstalls the Glassube package-operator from the current cluster and deletes all Glasskube Custom Resource Definitions.
**Warning:** This will delete all installed packages.

If you are unhappy with Glasskube we would love to hear your feedback, so please get in touch!

### `glasskube version`

Prints the version of the local Glasskube installation, as well as the installed cluster components.

### `glasskube --version`

Prints the version of the local Glasskube installation.

### `glasskube help`

Prints helpful information about `glasskube` and its commands.
Use `glasskube help <subcommand>` to learn more about a specific subcommand.
