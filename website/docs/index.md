# Welcome

üì¶Ô∏è Glasskube will help you to **install your favorite Kubernetes packages**.

ü§Ø Using **traditional package managers** or applying manifests can be **super confusing**.

üòç Using the **Glasskube UI** for reduced complexity and increased transparency.

üßë‚Äçüíª Still providing a **brew inspired CLI** for advanced users.

üèóÔ∏è Glasskube **packages are dependency aware**, as you would expect from a package manager.

ü§ñ  Designed as a cloud native application, so you can follow your **GitOps approach**.



> Glasskube is an open-source Kubernetes package manager that simplifies package management for Kubernetes.


## Fast Track ‚è±Ô∏è {#fast-track}

Install your first package in 5 minutes.


Install Glasskube via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install glasskube/tap/glasskube
```

Bootstrap Glasskube in your cluster:

```
glasskube bootstrap
```

Start the package manager:

```bash
glasskube serve
```

Open [`http://localhost:8580`](http://localhost:8580) and explore available packages.


For more installation options see the [Getting started](getting-started/install) section.

## Architecture üìè {#architecture}

Glasskube uses multiple components, most notably a client and a package operator.

### Components

#### Client

The client is an executable written in Go. It accepts user inputs via a UI and CLI.

The client manages packages in the form of Kubernetes Resources via the Kubernetes API.

#### Package Operator

The package operator has two controllers:

1. The Package Controller (managing packages)
2. The PackageInfo Controller (syncing package infos from a repository)

#### Package Repository

A place where `PackageManifest`s are stored, searched and maintained.
Currently only the glasskube packages repository is supported: [`glasskube/packages`](https://github.com/glasskube/packages)

## Commands

For any command, by default the cluster given in `~/.kube/config` (`current-context`) will be used.
An alternative kube config can be passed with the `--kubeconfig` flag.

### `glasskube bootstrap`

Bootstraps Glasskube in the given cluster. For more information, check out our [bootstrap guide](./getting-started/bootstrap).

### `glasskube serve`

Starts the UI server and opens a browser on [http://localhost:8580](http://localhost:8580).

### `glasskube install <package>`

Installs the latest version of a package in your cluster and waits until the installation is either finished successfully or failed.

Use `--version=...` if you want to install a specific version of a package, or `--enable-auto-updates` if you want a package to always be updated to the latest version automatically.

### `glasskube uninstall <package>`

Removes the given package from your cluster.

### `glasskube list`

Lists packages. By default, all packages available in the configured repository are shown, including their installation status in the given cluster.

With the `--installed` flag you can restrict the list of packages to the once installed in your cluster.

### `glasskube open <package>`

Opens the default entrypoint of the given package. 
Use `glasskube open <package> <entrypoint>` to open a specific entrypoint.

### `glasskube --version`

Prints the client version.

### `glasskube help`

Prints helpful information about `glasskube` and its commands.
