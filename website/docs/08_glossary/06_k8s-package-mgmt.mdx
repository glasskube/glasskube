## What is Kubernetes Package Management? Definition and explanation

### Definition

> Kubernetes package management refers to the process of managing, deploying, and maintaining [Kubernetes](/docs/glossary/kubernetes) applications using package managers, which simplify the handling of complex resources across multiple environments.

Package managers like [Helm](/docs/glossary/helm) and [Glasskube](/products/package-manager/) enable developers and operators to bundle Kubernetes resources together into reusable, shareable packages. These tools help to standardize application deployments, reduce the chance of misconfigurations, and speed up the entire process of rolling out Kubernetes applications.
