## What is Helm? Definition and explanation

### Helm definition
> Helm is a Kubernetes package manager that aides in the deployment, management, and scaling of applications within Kubernetes clusters. It uses "charts," which are pre-configured templates that bundle all the necessary Kubernetes resources for an application, enabling users to deploy, upgrade, and roll back applications easily. Helm helps to manage complex applications by automating tasks such as configuration, versioning, and dependency management, ensuring consistency across environments.
