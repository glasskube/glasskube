# Bootstrap

:::info
As Glasskube is still in technical preview a manual bootstrap is needed.<br/>
Automatic detection and bootstrapping will be implemented in a future version.
:::

In order to install packages in a Kubernetes cluster using Glasskube, it is necessary to install the required server components.
Conveniently, for most users this can be achieved by running `glasskube bootstrap` in a terminal.

The bootstrap command installs the Package Operator and it's associated Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
By default, the Package Operator is installed in an *All-In-One* (AIO) configuration.
This configuration comes bundled with a subset of Flux.
Glasskube is still compatible with any other GitOps solution, but Flux is a necessary requirement of the Package Operator.

If you already use Flux in your cluster or want to manage it yourself, first [install Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/bootstrap/),
and then Glasskube using a *slim* configuration by running `glasskube bootstrap --type=slim`.
