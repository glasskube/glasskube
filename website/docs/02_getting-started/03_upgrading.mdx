# Upgrading

## CLI

To upgrade the Glasskube CLI, simply install the latest version via your preferred package manager.

<Install />

## Cluster Components

To upgrade the Glasskube cluster components, run `glasskube boostrap` using the same configuration that was used for the initial installation.

## Breaking Changes

### Upgrading to v0.10.0 {#0.10.0}

While our goal is to prevent breaking changes if possible, this release includes several major changes in the Glasskube system:
1. The scope of the `Package` CRD has been changed from `Cluster` to `Namespaced`.
2. Flux components have been updated to the latest API version.
3. The naming strategy for `PackageInfo`s and `HelmRelease`s was changed.
4. The ownership model was overhauled in order to not rely on native `OwnerReferences`, since they have become limiting to our usecase.

Unfortunately, this means that a migration from prior releases is not supported.
Please remove Glasskube from your cluster using `glasskube purge`, then install the new version.

:::warning
This will remove all installed packages.
